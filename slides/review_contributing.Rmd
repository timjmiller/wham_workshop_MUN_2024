# Outline <br>

* Review what we have covered this week
* what we did not cover 
* How everyone can contribute!

---

# Getting data into WHAM

* Learned how to create input without ASAP files
    * This went surprisingly well
* Can adjust existing inputs using `set_*` functions

# Configuring selectivity

* Mean selectivity models
* Random effects are on the mean model parameters (not necessarily on ages)
* Can be used to model FAA varying over time like SAM
    * Some issues with calculating BRPs though

---

# Configuring recruitment and abundance at age

* Lots of options for initial numbers at age now
   * Probably doesn't matter much for recent population estimates
* Configuring NAA random effects pretty much the same as before
    * A lot of interest in alternative correlation structures for RE


# Configuring natural mortality

* Options for estimating constant natural mortality
  * by age
  * same annual REs across ages
  * For some ages and not others
  * On cohorts survival as well
  
# Configuring catchability

* time-varying catchability might be helpful for
    * indices that cover a small portion of the stock area
    * species with life styles that are not observed well by the survey

---

# Debugging WHAM

* Use nll reporting to deduce where NA issues are.
* Think hard about input CVs and age comp sample sizes
* If optimizer finishes but convergence is lacking probably
    * initial numbers at age 
    * selectivity pars
    * variance pars
* If optimizer can't even get off the line
    * adjust mean recruitment pars, log NAA, or initial F to allow observed catch to be taken

# Environmental effects

* If observation error estimates available use them
    * estimating observation SD can provide rosy picture of effects of covariates
* Consider comparing models with and without covariates that both have residual variability
    * Happens automatically with recruitment, but not as obvious for other things

---

# Reference points and projections

* Need to be careful of XSPR_R_opt for prevailing static reference points
* Lots of options for configuring projections for 
    * F, Catch, M, Covariates, WAA, maturity

# Simulation

* Endless possibilities
    * Self tests
    * Cross tests
    * Simulating an imaginary fish stock
    * Closed-loop simulation

# What we did not cover

* Covariate effects on movement
* Reference points and projections with multiple fleets, stocks, regions

---

# Contributing to help improve WHAM

* Needs 
    * git installed
    * a github account
* You can use git and github through Rstudio or many other coding environments
* You can help without knowing C++ and TMB!
* Developing on the R side can help with
    * Summarizing input and output from models
    * Summarizing model configuration specified by the user
    * Generating output to facilitate reporting for management

---

# Steps to contributing

* First clone the repo as a `wham` directory. 
    * Using the command line from an appropriate parent directory:
        * `git clone https://github.com/timjmiller/wham.git`
    * Now you have the WHAM repo!
* Switch to devel branch (or other branch to work from)
    * `git checkout devel`
* Create a branch off of devel appropriately named (e.g., "new_branch_name") for what you want to add
    * `git branch new_banch_name`
* Then switch to your new branch
    *  `git checkout new_branch_name`
* Make all amazing changes to WHAM
    * E.g., write a new R function that makes a table with columns: Year, SSB, R, F and corresponding SD, and CIs  


---

# Steps to contributing


* Make some simple tests of these changes for future development
    * see `tests` directory of repo for inspiration
* Make sure your branch is up to date with parent branch
    * `git fetch`
    * `git merge devel` (resolve any merge conflicts)
* Submit pull request when
    * `devtools::test()` completes successfully 
    * `devtools::document()` completes successfully
* Workflow: 
    * If you intend only to add a useful R function, just need to compile the model once.
        * From an R session in the wham directory run `pkgbuild::compile_dll(debug = FALSE)`
        * Then `pkgload::load_all()` will load the WHAM package from your local copy of the repo
        * During development of R function(s) can repeatedly call `pkgload::load_all()` to update your package with changes to the R function(s).
        * See Roxygen code in other WHAM functions to see how to write help files for the new function(s).
    * Developing TMB features is an advanced level of contribution, 
        * Need to successfully compile the model with the changes.
        * Overcoming C++ bugs causing failed compilation is...satisfying.
